Iris classification involves predicting the species of iris flowers based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It's a common machine learning task, with algorithms like logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, and neural networks being applied to classify iris flowers into species, typically setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The goal is to train a model on labeled data and then use it to predict the species of unseen iris flowers.
